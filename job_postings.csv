Apply For Kenya Scholar-Athlete Project (KenSAP) Scholarships,https://opportunitiesforyoungkenyans.co.ke/2018/01/03/aplly-kenya-scholar-athlete-project-kensap-scholarships/,"Selection of Candidates From more than 100 qualified applicants each year, KenSAP selects a between twelve and fifteen students. The approach is holistic, like that of top American universities, but it starts with the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), Kenyas national high school leaving exam. As soon as the exam results come out, KenSAP starts receiving queries from students who have met the programs baseline requirement  a mean grade of A plain, the highest possible mark on the exam, achieved by about 12 of 1% of the more than 500,000 test takers. To broaden the programs reach, a radio announcement solicits queries from any new high school graduates who have scored A plain. Any student who shows evidence of having met the requirement is sent a detailed application form that includes several essays. On the basis of the application and the KCSE result, KenSAPs selection panel chooses a short-list of 60, who are invited to the programs tryout, which consists of an interview, a diagnostic test and a 1500-meter run. Students Backgrounds During selection, considerable weight is attached to students backgrounds, with preference given to those from uneducated households or otherwise disadvantaged circumstances. A majority of those selected come from peasant farming families; most are first-generation university, and many are first-generation high school. The Athlete Component For decades Kenyas renowned abundance of running talent has produced a steady flow of gifted runners to American universities on athletic scholarships. Most students granted athletic scholarships have attended institutions of somewhat lesser academic distinction than those to which KenSAP students apply. However, even Americas most academically selective institutions recruit athletes  a fact of which KenSAPs founders were well aware  and Kenyas wealth of running talent led the founders to expect that at least a few KenSAP students, though chosen largely for their academic accomplishments, might also turn out to be runners who would interest coaches at academically selective colleges, and thereby strengthen the students chances of admission. For that reason, all KenSAP students participate in regular athletic training during the programs residential sessions. So far, about 20% of the students in the program have had the support of college coaches during the admission process; several have become valuable contributors to their college teams, and one was a nine-time NCAA Division III national champion!

The student does not have to be an athlete and the scholarships are not course specific. Selection of Candidates From more than 100 qualified applicants each year, KenSAP selects a between twelve and fifteen students. The approach is holistic, like that of top American universities, but it starts with the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE), Kenyas national high school leaving exam. As soon as the exam results come out, KenSAP starts receiving queries from students who have met the programs baseline requirement  a mean grade of A plain, the highest possible mark on the exam, achieved by about 12 of 1% of the more than 500,000 test takers. To broaden the programs reach, a radio announcement solicits queries from any new high school graduates who have scored A plain. Any student who shows evidence of having met the requirement is sent a detailed application form that includes several essays. On the basis of the application and the KCSE result, KenSAPs selection panel chooses a short-list of 60, who are invited to the programs tryout, which consists of an interview, a diagnostic test and a 1500-meter run. Students Backgrounds During selection, considerable weight is attached to students backgrounds, with preference given to those from uneducated households or otherwise disadvantaged circumstances. A majority of those selected come from peasant farming families; most are first-generation university, and many are first-generation high school.

Consultants  Editors,https://opportunitiesforyoungkenyans.co.ke/2018/01/13/consultants-editors/,"Description CALL FOR CONSULTANTS  EDITORS Clients Contact Details Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) West End Towers, 4th Floor, Kanjata Road, off Muthangari Drive P.O. Box 66773 Westlands, 00800 Nairobi, Kenya Main Off. Tel: +254 (20) 3675 000 Contact Person Head of Procurement at [email protected] BACKGROUND The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa  AGRA, is an African-led alliance focused on putting smallholder farmers at the center of the continents growing economy by transforming agriculture from a solitary struggle to survive into farming as a business that thrives. Founded in 2006, at a time when agricultural development was emerging from a 20-year decline characterized by minimal growth and investment in the sector, AGRAs mission is to catalyze and sustain an agricultural transformation in Africa through innovation-driven productivity increases and access to markets and finance that improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. From the beginning, AGRA was positioned to tailor the research, technologies, and lessons of the world to the needs and opportunities of smallholder farmers in particular agro-ecologies and farming systems. AGRAs approach was private sector driven and represented a more robust and sustainable way of addressing chronic, systemic failures in African agricultural development. Together with its partnersincluding African governments, researchers, donors, the private sector and civil society AGRA works to catalyze an agricultural transformation in Africa through innovation-driven and sustainable productivity increases and access to innovative finance and markets that improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. As the sector that employs the majority of Africas people, nearly all of them smallholder farmers, AGRA recognizes that transforming agriculture into a productive, efficient, and sustainable system is essential to ensuring food security, lifting millions out of poverty, and driving equitable growth across the continent. AGRA will aim to catalyze and sustain inclusive agricultural transformations through integrated, country-based investment plans in 11 countries with high potential for take-off over the next five years. To deliver this transformation, AGRA and partners will draw on experiences gained over the last decade to implement a fully integrated set of activities in 11 countries located mainly in three high-potential, under-exploited agro-ecologies  the Guinea Savannah Zone (West Africa), the East African Highlands, and the Miombo Woodland (Southern Africa), where it has developed agricultural technologies, understands the landscape and has strong partnerships. AGRAs overall vision of success is centered on three headline goals to achieve by 2020 through its efforts to catalyze, convene, and align with an alliance of partners and grantees: To support 11 African countries on a pathway to create and sustain agricultural transformation. The investment will empower AGRA to work through an ecosystem of public and private partners to work with government and private sector to overcome bottlenecks and unlock transformation. As part of this effort, AGRA will work to generate evidence and follow up with targeted technical, planning and coordination support. To increase the incomes and food security for 9 million farm households through the direct result of activities of AGRA, grantees, and partners to increase productivity and access to markets and finance in six countries where it is seeking to catalyze an agricultural transformation. At this level, AGRA wants to help farmers adopt an integrated package of improved seeds, fertilizers, and agronomic practices that close the yield gap sustainably in staple crops, and consequently enabled to support and improve their families well-being  through increased food security and additional income. To contribute to increasing the incomes and food security of another 21 million farm households through the contributions of AGRA, grantees, and partners to policies, programs, and partnerships that increase productivity and access to markets and finance in other countries where an agricultural transformation is already under way, but needs to be sustained. In the attainment of these goals, AGRA will support progress towards transformation through integrated delivery approaches to achieve tipping points  the moment when the build-up of new activities, innovations, and solutions becomes self-sustaining and will no longer need AGRAs support- at farmer, system and national level. This will minimize the philanthropic and public subsidy required from AGRA, while also ensuring these contributions are catalytic and create sustainable change at scale. Communication has been central to this transformation and will play an even more crucial role in ensuring that our messages and stories of change and impact are pro-actively identified, packaged in formats that appeal and shared through multiple digital platforms optimizing, traditional, new and social media. To complement our in-house capabilities and capacity to deliver a world class communication function, we are hiring consultant editors, writers, stringers and a technology developer.

Xavier Project Primary School Teacher Job,https://opportunitiesforyoungkenyans.co.ke/2018/01/19/xavier-project-primary-school-teacher-job/,"Job Title: Teacher for Primary School Accelerated Education Programme (AEP) Area of Operation: Umoja/ Kayole Nairobi Salary Range: KES 40,000 to 50,000 The vision of Xavier Project is for a world where everyone has the right to equal opportunities and protection wherever they live and whatever their background. This right is denied to refugees and we use education to change this. Education provides protection and is the best possible tool to help refugees to access equal opportunities. At Xavier Project we use pioneering education as the means to achieve our vision. We are promoting education for refugees in Kenya and Uganda in particular, so that they can have a positive difference on their communities, whether in their host countries or countries of origin. Xavier Project has two departments each with their own strategic objective designed to meet this vision. The Education Department aims to increase access to relevant, quality formal education delivered in a safe environment for refugee children. The Tamuka Department aims to make vocational and life-long learning available to all refugees even in emergency situations, primarily through the use of ICT. Xavier Project is registered as a local NGO in Uganda, an international NGO in Kenya and a company and charity in UK. All operations are in Kenya and Uganda, but a majority of funds are raised in UK. We have a three way partnership agreement between the branches of Xavier Project and one executive team primarily based in the Xavier Project headquarters in Nairobi. Xavier Project currently employs 28 permanent staff and has an annual income of $500,000 which has been increasing by 50% every year since its founding in 2008. Background: Urban refugees in East Africa face unique challenges. Culturally, it is difficult to assimilate into their new communities as they can be victims of xenophobia and can struggle from language differences. They cannot easily find jobs in a saturated and often nepotistic job market. There are administrative barriers to economic sustainability such as the challenge of obtaining work permits, and the rejection of foreign qualifications from employers and institutions. At present many refugees in Nairobi or Kampala do not have access to quality, relevant education delivered in a safe environment and their opportunities in education lag behind those of their local counterparts. In both Kampala and Nairobi there are over 10,000 refugee children who are not in formal education, amounting to around 50% in Nairobi and 60% in Kampala. 80% of those in formal education are not happy with the quality of the education they are receiving. Program Description: Xavier Project is opening a learning center in Umoja to support the education of urban refugee youth who have missed school for prolonged periods of time for different reasons. The Accelerated Education Program (AEP) aims at ensuring that such youth (aged 12-18 years) have access to basic education through using the non-formal primary Education curriculum provided by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD). This will accord them a chance to acquire equivalent certified competencies for primary education through flexible school schedules and learning approaches that match their cognitive maturity. We are therefore looking for a suitably qualified P1 teacher with appropriate qualifications and experience to help fulfil this mandate. Job Description and required qualifications: Under the supervision of the Education Officer, the incumbent will support the performance of the following functions: Ensure regular attendance of at least 100 refugee background primary school-going across the different AEP levels Teach all the 5 Primary School AEP subjects across the different levels: (English, Kiswahili, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies) Prepare schemes of work, lesson plans and notes, and relevant teaching/learning resources Maintain relevant records including: daily attendance, record of work covered, meetings, assessment of learning, inventories etc. Carry out daily registration and ensure continuous learning, safety, welfare and comfort of all the learners Profile all attending learners in terms of language and academic competencies and offer appropriate remedial support Identify and document any psycho-social needs of learners and offer appropriate guidance and counselling and/or referrals to relevant partners Hold and document regular consultative forums with the Learning Center Committee as the Secretary Arrange regular meetings with each learners parent/guardian to review progress and advice on improvement Hold relevant activities and events that enhance the learning progress and talent development of all learners Help clean and maintain the Learning Center including furniture and learning materials and ensure their safety and security Any other relevant duty that may be assigned to you from time to time Qualifications Required Education  Professional Teacher Training (minimum P1) Teachers Service Commission (TSC) Registration Diploma/Degree in Education will be added advantage Minimum 2 years teaching in a primary school.
